    "- In defining social media, we followed a formalized definition to remove ambiguity when determining study eligibility. Obar and Wildman, define social media by the following four characteristics: '1) social media services are (currently) applications that are Web 2.0 Internet-based; 2) the lifeblood of social media is user-generated content; 3) for a site or app designed and maintained by a social media service, individuals and groups create user-specific profiles, and; 4) the development of social networks online by connecting a profile with those of other individuals and/or groups is facilitated by social media services.'",
    "- During title and abstract screening, studies were only selected for inclusion if the information provided in the title or abstract indicated that the study specifically explored COVID-19 misinformation on social media. This meant that a study was considered eligible regardless of whether CAIM was discussed in the articleâ€™s full text. This decision was made to avoid excluding relevant articles that include CAIM discussion in the full text, but not within the title or abstract.",
    "- Only primary research articles are (e.g., cross-sectional studies, descriptive analyses, questionnaire based studies, etc.) were considered and included in this scoping review.",
    "- Review articles were not eligible for inclusion in this review.",
    "- Research protocols, abstracts, editorials, opinion pieces, commentaries, and any non-English texts were not eligible for inclusion in this scoping review."
