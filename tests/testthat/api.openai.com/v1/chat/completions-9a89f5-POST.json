Nursing homes are typically considered residential aged care facilities providing the necessary daily living and nursing support.\n\n3. **Context**: The study measures outcomes related to \"depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS),\" which closely aligns with the review's focus on stress reduction, emotional well-being, and similar outcomes.\n\nBased on these evaluations, the study titled \"Therapy Alpaca Visits Reduce Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Australian Nursing Home Residents\" fits the inclusion criteria for the scoping review. It examines the role of therapy alpacas in enhancing the mental health and emotional well-being of elderly residents in aged care facilities.",
