It is a randomized control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17 nursing homes in Australia, comparing a weekly 2-hour therapy alpaca visit to a control group with television viewing. The intervention showed significant reductions in DAS scores.\n\n### Screening Decision:\n\n**Meets Inclusion Criteria**:\n1. **Population**: The population studied is nursing home residents.\n2. **Intervention**: The intervention is therapy animal visits (therapy alpacas).\n3. **Comparison**: There is a control group (television viewing).\n4. **Outcomes**: The study measures outcomes on depression, anxiety, and stress.\n5. **Study Design**: The study is a randomized control trial (RCT).\n6. **Publication Type**: Based on the abstract, it appears to be a peer-reviewed article.\n\n**Does Not Meet Exclusion Criteria**:\n1. **Population**: Does not focus on independently living elderly.\n2. **Intervention**: Involves animal-assisted intervention.\n3. **Outcomes**: Measures DAS outcomes.\n4. **Study Design**: Not a case report, qualitative study, or review.\n5. **Publication Type**: Presumably a peer-reviewed article.\n\n### Decision: **Include**\n\nThis source meets all the inclusion criteria and does not meet any of the exclusion criteria for the scoping review.",
