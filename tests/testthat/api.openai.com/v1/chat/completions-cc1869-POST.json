The abstract does not specify the age range of participants, but since it refers to “nursing home residents,” it is reasonable to assume they fit this criterion.\n\n2. **Concept**: The study involves the use of therapy alpacas in a residential aged care setting. Nursing homes generally provide support for daily living and nursing care, which matches the definition of residential aged care facilities according to the criteria.\n\n3. **Context**: The outcomes measured in the study include levels of depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS), which are relevant to the context criteria of stress reduction, emotional well-being, and mental health outcomes.\n\nThe source meets the scope of the review objective and all specified inclusion criteria. Therefore, it should be included in the scoping review.",
