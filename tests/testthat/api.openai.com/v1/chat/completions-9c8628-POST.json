Studies involving elderly populations residing in nursing homes.\n2. Studies examining non-pharmacological interventions.\n3. Studies measuring outcomes related to depression, anxiety, and/or stress.\n4. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before-and-after studies, and observational studies.\n5. Studies published in English.\n\n**Exclusion Criteria:**\n1. Studies focusing on populations not residing in nursing homes.\n2. Studies involving pharmacological interventions.\n3. Reviews, meta-analyses, editorials, commentaries, or case reports.\n4. Incomplete studies or studies with unpublished data.\n5. Studies not measuring any DAS outcomes.\n6. Studies not published in English.\n\n**Source Screening:**\n\n**Title:** Therapy Alpaca Visits Reduce Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Australian Nursing Home Residents\n\n**Abstract:** Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations living independently. As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality, DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy alpacas have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents. We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17 nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised to either a weekly 2-hour therapy alpaca visit or equivalent time in a television viewing lounge. Residents receiving the alpaca intervention had significantly (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean DASS-21 score for depression reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction 11 points), and stress (mean reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm. This study represents the first large-scale randomised trial of alpaca therapy for nursing home residents and provides strong support for its effectiveness in reducing DAS.\n\n**Does the source meet the review criteria?**\nYes.\n\n**Rationale:**\n1. **Population:** The study involves elderly populations residing in nursing homes, meeting the population criterion.\n2. **Intervention:** The study examines a non-pharmacological intervention (therapy alpaca visits), which aligns with the intervention criterion.\n3. **Outcomes:** The study measures DAS-related outcomes (depression, anxiety, and stress), satisfying the outcomes criterion.\n4. **Study Design:** The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is included in the acceptable study designs.\n5. **Language:** The abstract is provided in English, meeting the language criterion.\n\nGiven that the source fits all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, it should be included in the scoping review.",
