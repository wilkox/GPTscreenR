        This scoping review will examine the existing primary research on the role

        have used therapy alpacas as part of their programme of care for residents.
        ''Residential aged care facility'' is defined as a residential setting intended
        as a long-term place of residence for elderly people which includes provision
        of support for activities of daily living (e.g. meal preparation, bathing,
        housekeeping) and nursing support (e.g. medication management). Such facilities
        will also typically offer other structured programmes and facilities to provide
        entertainment, diversion, and wellbeing. It excludes other residential settings
        intended for elderly people that do no provide daily living or nursing supports

        Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Australian Nursing Home Residents\nABSTRACT:
        Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression, anxiety, and stress
        (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations living independently.
        As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality,
        DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems
        in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy alpacas
        have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents.
        We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17
        nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised
        to either a weekly 2-hour therapy alpaca visit or equivalent time in a television
        viewing lounge. Residents receiving the alpaca intervention had significantly
        (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean DASS-21 score for depression
        reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction 11 points) and stress (mean
        reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm. This study represents the
        first large-scale randomised trial of alpaca therapy for nursing home residents,
        and provides strong support for its effectiveness in reducing DAS."}],"stream":false}'

        This scoping review will examine the existing primary research on the role
        of therapy alpacas in enhancing the mental health and emotional well-being
        of elderly residential aged care facility residents\n\nPOPULATION:Elderly
        people living in residential aged care facilities. ''Elderly'' is defined
        as 65 years of age or older.\n\nCONCEPT:Residential aged care facilities that
        have used therapy alpacas as part of their programme of care for residents.
        ''Residential aged care facility'' is defined as a residential setting intended
        as a long-term place of residence for elderly people which includes provision
        of support for activities of daily living (e.g. meal preparation, bathing,
        housekeeping) and nursing support (e.g. medication management). Such facilities
        will also typically offer other structured programmes and facilities to provide
        entertainment, diversion, and wellbeing. It excludes other residential settings
        intended for elderly people that do no provide daily living or nursing supports
        (e.g. independent living villages) or that are not long-term (e.g. hospitals
        or hospices).\n\nCONTEXT:The impact of therapy alpaca programmes on stress
        reduction, emotional well-being, mental health, overall life satisfaction,
        or similar outcomes for residents.\n\n\nTITLE: Therapy Alpaca Visits Reduce
        Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Australian Nursing Home Residents\nABSTRACT:
        Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression, anxiety, and stress
        (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations living independently.
        As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality,
        DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems
        in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy alpacas
        have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents.
        We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17
        nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised
        to either a weekly 2-hour therapy alpaca visit or equivalent time in a television
        viewing lounge. Residents receiving the alpaca intervention had significantly
        (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean DASS-21 score for depression
        reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction 11 points) and stress (mean
        reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm. This study represents the
        first large-scale randomised trial of alpaca therapy for nursing home residents,
        and provides strong support for its effectiveness in reducing DAS."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Based
        on the provided title and abstract, I will assess whether this source aligns

        health, overall life satisfaction, or similar outcomes for residents in residential

        target population (elderly people living in residential aged care facilities)

        like to note that this study seems to be a randomized controlled trial rather
        than primary research that focuses on qualitative or semi-quantitative aspects.
        While it provides quantitative data on the effectiveness of therapy alpaca
        visits in reducing depression, anxiety, and stress among nursing home residents,
        its findings may not be directly relevant to the review''s objectives.\n\nConsidering
        these points, I would classify this source as NOT meeting the inclusion criteria
