        OBJECTIVE: This scoping review will examine the existing primary research
        on the role of therapy alpacas in enhancing the mental health and emotional
        well-being of elderly residential aged care facility residents\n\nPOPULATION:Elderly
        people living in residential aged care facilities. ''Elderly'' is defined
        as 65 years of age or older.\n\nCONCEPT:Residential aged care facilities that
        have used therapy alpacas as part of their programme of care for residents.
        ''Residential aged care facility'' is defined as a residential setting intended
        as a long-term place of residence for elderly people which includes provision
        of support for activities of daily living (e.g. meal preparation, bathing,
        housekeeping) and nursing support (e.g. medication management). Such facilities
        will also typically offer other structured programmes and facilities to provide
        entertainment, diversion, and wellbeing. It excludes other residential settings
        intended for elderly people that do no provide daily living or nursing supports
        (e.g. independent living villages) or that are not long-term (e.g. hospitals
        or hospices).\n\nCONTEXT:The impact of therapy alpaca programmes on stress
        reduction, emotional well-being, mental health, overall life satisfaction,
        or similar outcomes for residents.\n\n\nTITLE: Therapy Alpaca Visits Reduce
        Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Australian Nursing Home Residents\nABSTRACT:
        Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression, anxiety, and stress
        (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations living independently.
        As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality,
        DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems
        in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy alpacas
        have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents.
        We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17
        nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised
        to either a weekly 2-hour therapy alpaca visit or equivalent time in a television
        viewing lounge. Residents receiving the alpaca intervention had significantly
        (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean DASS-21 score for depression
        reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction 11 points) and stress (mean
        reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm. This study represents the
        first large-scale randomised trial of alpaca therapy for nursing home residents,
        and provides strong support for its effectiveness in reducing DAS."}]}'

        OBJECTIVE: This scoping review will examine the existing primary research
        on the role of therapy alpacas in enhancing the mental health and emotional
        well-being of elderly residential aged care facility residents\n\nPOPULATION:Elderly
        people living in residential aged care facilities. ''Elderly'' is defined
        as 65 years of age or older.\n\nCONCEPT:Residential aged care facilities that
        have used therapy alpacas as part of their programme of care for residents.
        ''Residential aged care facility'' is defined as a residential setting intended
        as a long-term place of residence for elderly people which includes provision
        of support for activities of daily living (e.g. meal preparation, bathing,
        housekeeping) and nursing support (e.g. medication management). Such facilities
        will also typically offer other structured programmes and facilities to provide
        entertainment, diversion, and wellbeing. It excludes other residential settings
        intended for elderly people that do no provide daily living or nursing supports
        (e.g. independent living villages) or that are not long-term (e.g. hospitals
        or hospices).\n\nCONTEXT:The impact of therapy alpaca programmes on stress
        reduction, emotional well-being, mental health, overall life satisfaction,
        or similar outcomes for residents.\n\n\nTITLE: Therapy Alpaca Visits Reduce
        Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Australian Nursing Home Residents\nABSTRACT:
        Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression, anxiety, and stress
        (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations living independently.
        As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality,
        DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems
        in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy alpacas
        have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents.
        We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17
        nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised
        to either a weekly 2-hour therapy alpaca visit or equivalent time in a television
        viewing lounge. Residents receiving the alpaca intervention had significantly
        (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean DASS-21 score for depression
        reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction 11 points) and stress (mean
        reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm. This study represents the
        first large-scale randomised trial of alpaca therapy for nursing home residents,
        and provides strong support for its effectiveness in reducing DAS."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Based

        OBJECTIVE: This scoping review will examine the existing primary research
        on the role of therapy alpacas in enhancing the mental health and emotional
        well-being of elderly residential aged care facility residents\n\nPOPULATION:Elderly
        people living in residential aged care facilities. ''Elderly'' is defined
        as 65 years of age or older.\n\nCONCEPT:Residential aged care facilities that
        have used therapy alpacas as part of their programme of care for residents.
        ''Residential aged care facility'' is defined as a residential setting intended
        as a long-term place of residence for elderly people which includes provision
        of support for activities of daily living (e.g. meal preparation, bathing,
        housekeeping) and nursing support (e.g. medication management). Such facilities
        will also typically offer other structured programmes and facilities to provide
        entertainment, diversion, and wellbeing. It excludes other residential settings
        intended for elderly people that do no provide daily living or nursing supports
        (e.g. independent living villages) or that are not long-term (e.g. hospitals
        or hospices).\n\nCONTEXT:The impact of therapy alpaca programmes on stress
        reduction, emotional well-being, mental health, overall life satisfaction,
        or similar outcomes for residents.\n\n\nTITLE: Therapy Alpaca Visits Reduce
        Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Australian Nursing Home Residents\nABSTRACT:
        Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression, anxiety, and stress
        (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations living independently.
        As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality,
        DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems
        in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy alpacas
        have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents.
        We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17
        nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised
        to either a weekly 2-hour therapy alpaca visit or equivalent time in a television
        viewing lounge. Residents receiving the alpaca intervention had significantly

        OBJECTIVE: This scoping review will examine the existing primary research
        on the role of therapy alpacas in enhancing the mental health and emotional
        well-being of elderly residential aged care facility residents\n\nPOPULATION:Elderly
        people living in residential aged care facilities. ''Elderly'' is defined
        as 65 years of age or older.\n\nCONCEPT:Residential aged care facilities that
        have used therapy alpacas as part of their programme of care for residents.
        ''Residential aged care facility'' is defined as a residential setting intended
        as a long-term place of residence for elderly people which includes provision
        of support for activities of daily living (e.g. meal preparation, bathing,
        housekeeping) and nursing support (e.g. medication management). Such facilities
        will also typically offer other structured programmes and facilities to provide
        entertainment, diversion, and wellbeing. It excludes other residential settings
        intended for elderly people that do no provide daily living or nursing supports
        (e.g. independent living villages) or that are not long-term (e.g. hospitals
        or hospices).\n\nCONTEXT:The impact of therapy alpaca programmes on stress

        Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Australian Nursing Home Residents\nABSTRACT:
        Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression, anxiety, and stress
        (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations living independently.
        As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality,
        DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems
        in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy alpacas
        have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents.
        We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17
        nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised
        to either a weekly 2-hour therapy alpaca visit or equivalent time in a television
        viewing lounge. Residents receiving the alpaca intervention had significantly
        (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean DASS-21 score for depression
        reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction 11 points) and stress (mean
        reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm. This study represents the

        as a long-term place of residence for elderly people which includes provision
        of support for activities of daily living (e.g. meal preparation, bathing,
        housekeeping) and nursing support (e.g. medication management). Such facilities
        will also typically offer other structured programmes and facilities to provide
        entertainment, diversion, and wellbeing. It excludes other residential settings
        intended for elderly people that do no provide daily living or nursing supports
        (e.g. independent living villages) or that are not long-term (e.g. hospitals
        or hospices).\n\nCONTEXT:The impact of therapy alpaca programmes on stress
        reduction, emotional well-being, mental health, overall life satisfaction,
        or similar outcomes for residents.\n\n\nTITLE: Therapy Alpaca Visits Reduce
        Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Australian Nursing Home Residents\nABSTRACT:
        Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression, anxiety, and stress
        (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations living independently.
        As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality,
        DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems
        in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy alpacas
        have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents.
        We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17
        nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised
        to either a weekly 2-hour therapy alpaca visit or equivalent time in a television
        viewing lounge. Residents receiving the alpaca intervention had significantly
        (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean DASS-21 score for depression
        reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction 11 points) and stress (mean
        reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm. This study represents the
        first large-scale randomised trial of alpaca therapy for nursing home residents,
        and provides strong support for its effectiveness in reducing DAS."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Based
        on the provided review objective and criteria, let''s evaluate if the source
        fits within the scope of the review:\n\n1. **Population**: The source focuses
        on nursing home residents, which aligns with the population criteria of elderly
        people living in residential aged care facilities. The mention of residents
        suggests they are likely 65 years or older, consistent with the definition
        of \"elderly.\"\n\n2. **Concept**: The study involves therapy alpacas being
        used as part of a program of care in nursing homes, which are facilities that
        provide activities of daily living and nursing support. This fits the concept
        criterion perfectly.\n\n3. **Context**: The study examines the impact of therapy
        alpacas on emotional well-being and mental health, focusing on depression,

        Alpaca Visits Reduce Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Australian Nursing
        Home Residents\nABSTRACT: Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression,
        anxiety, and stress (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations
        living independently. As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity
        and mortality, DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes
        and health systems in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use
        of therapy alpacas have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among
        nursing home residents. We conducted a randomised control trial involving
        8,124 residents across 17 nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which
        residents were randomised to either a weekly 2-hour therapy alpaca visit or
        equivalent time in a television viewing lounge. Residents receiving the alpaca
        intervention had significantly (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean
        DASS-21 score for depression reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction
        11 points) and stress (mean reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm.
        This study represents the first large-scale randomised trial of alpaca therapy

        OBJECTIVE: This scoping review will examine the existing primary research
        on the role of therapy alpacas in enhancing the mental health and emotional
        well-being of elderly residential aged care facility residents\n\nPOPULATION:Elderly
        people living in residential aged care facilities. ''Elderly'' is defined
        as 65 years of age or older.\n\nCONCEPT:Residential aged care facilities that
        have used therapy alpacas as part of their programme of care for residents.
        ''Residential aged care facility'' is defined as a residential setting intended
        as a long-term place of residence for elderly people which includes provision
        of support for activities of daily living (e.g. meal preparation, bathing,
        housekeeping) and nursing support (e.g. medication management). Such facilities
        will also typically offer other structured programmes and facilities to provide
        entertainment, diversion, and wellbeing. It excludes other residential settings
        intended for elderly people that do no provide daily living or nursing supports
        (e.g. independent living villages) or that are not long-term (e.g. hospitals
        or hospices).\n\nCONTEXT:The impact of therapy alpaca programmes on stress
        reduction, emotional well-being, mental health, overall life satisfaction,
        or similar outcomes for residents.\n\n\nTITLE: Therapy Alpaca Visits Reduce
        Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Australian Nursing Home Residents\nABSTRACT:
        Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression, anxiety, and stress
        (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations living independently.
        As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality,
        DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems
        in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy alpacas
        have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents.
        We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17
        nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised
        to either a weekly 2-hour therapy alpaca visit or equivalent time in a television
        viewing lounge. Residents receiving the alpaca intervention had significantly
        (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean DASS-21 score for depression
        reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction 11 points) and stress (mean
        reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm. This study represents the
        first large-scale randomised trial of alpaca therapy for nursing home residents,
        and provides strong support for its effectiveness in reducing DAS."}]}'

        OBJECTIVE: This scoping review will examine the existing primary research
        on the role of therapy alpacas in enhancing the mental health and emotional
        well-being of elderly residential aged care facility residents\n\nPOPULATION:Elderly
        people living in residential aged care facilities. ''Elderly'' is defined
        as 65 years of age or older.\n\nCONCEPT:Residential aged care facilities that
        have used therapy alpacas as part of their programme of care for residents.
        ''Residential aged care facility'' is defined as a residential setting intended
        as a long-term place of residence for elderly people which includes provision
        of support for activities of daily living (e.g. meal preparation, bathing,
        housekeeping) and nursing support (e.g. medication management). Such facilities
        will also typically offer other structured programmes and facilities to provide
        entertainment, diversion, and wellbeing. It excludes other residential settings
        intended for elderly people that do no provide daily living or nursing supports
        (e.g. independent living villages) or that are not long-term (e.g. hospitals
        or hospices).\n\nCONTEXT:The impact of therapy alpaca programmes on stress
        reduction, emotional well-being, mental health, overall life satisfaction,
        or similar outcomes for residents.\n\n\nTITLE: Therapy Alpaca Visits Reduce
        Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Australian Nursing Home Residents\nABSTRACT:
        Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression, anxiety, and stress
        (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations living independently.
        As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality,
        DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems
        in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy alpacas
        have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents.
        We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17
        nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised
        to either a weekly 2-hour therapy alpaca visit or equivalent time in a television
        viewing lounge. Residents receiving the alpaca intervention had significantly
        (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean DASS-21 score for depression
        reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction 11 points) and stress (mean
        reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm. This study represents the
        first large-scale randomised trial of alpaca therapy for nursing home residents,
        and provides strong support for its effectiveness in reducing DAS."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Based
